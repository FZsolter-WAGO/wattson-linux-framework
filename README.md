# WattsON Energy Linux framework installer

## Only Debian 10/11 and Ubuntu 22.04 are supported!

### Usage
```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FZsolter-WAGO/wattson-linux-framework/main/bin/install.sh | sudo bash
```
### Tip
This should be used only once during the initial setup of the system, since the recommended way of installing WattsON Energy on Linux is using a fresh new minimized OS install on a dedicated hardware only for this one purpose.
